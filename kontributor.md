Creating an issue

Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.

Any GitHub user can create an issue in a public repository where issues have not been disabled.

You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request. For more information, see "Opening an issue from code."

If you're using a project board to track and prioritize your work, you can convert project board notes to issues. For more information, see "Adding notes to a project board."

Tips: Project maintainers can choose to:

    Create an issue template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information the project's maintainers prefer to see in the body of an issue.
    Disable issues for a repository. (Pull requests can't be turned off and are always available.)

=> On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
=> Under your repository name, click Issues. 
=> Click New issue. 
=> Type a title and description for your issue. 
=> If you're a project maintainer, you can assign the issue to someone, add it to a    project board, associate it with a milestone, or apply a label.
=> When you're finished, click Submit new issue.
